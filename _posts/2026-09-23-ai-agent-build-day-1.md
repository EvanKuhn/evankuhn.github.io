description: Progress and lessons from building an AI agent in Python
---

Recently I decided to build an AI agent "from scratch", using Python. My primary motivation is
learning; I want to better understand the technology landscape and how the pieces fit together.
This post covers my progress and learnings from my work yesterday.

I'm using Ollama to run models locally, Python to interact with the models via the ollama package,
and Claude as my AI coding assistant. I built a small proof-of-concept earlier, which makes a single
call to the LLM and prints the results.

My GitHub repo: [github.com/EvanKuhn/agents](https://github.com/EvanKuhn/agents)

## Progress
Yesterday's accomplishments:

- Add `PLAN.md` to list and track project milestones.
- Add a loop to the agent, and add in-context memory. Previous messages are saved and fed back into
  the model within the current conversation.
- Render agent output as markdown, and include a status bar (showing time, token count, and status).
- Support thinking models.
- Support personas (socratic, terse, pirate)
- Support basic tool use (calculator, list files, read file, get time)
- Add initial system prompt

## Learnings

### Ollama API Format

Ollama uses structured JSON for API input and output. The format is based on work by OpenAI:

- OpenAI's [Chat Completions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/chat-completions/overview)
  (March 2023) introduced a `messages` array of `{role, content}` objects using
  `system`/`user`/`assistant`. This replaced the older single-string prompt APIs and was widely
  copied.
- OpenAI's [function calling](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling)
  (June 2023) expected function calls to be passed using a JSON schema. Each tool has `name`,
  `description`, and `parameters` fields, which the model can reference for tool calls.

Ollama's native `/api/chat` format is heavily influenced by OpenAI's work, but not identical.
However, Ollama does provide an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `/v1/chat/completions`, which allows
software written for the OpenAI API to instead use Ollama.

### Model Types and Tool Use

The biggest learning today was around tool use. Though it's unsurprising in hindsight, I was unaware
of the extent to which different models succeed or fail with tool use. For example, qwen3 succeeded
quite well, while llama3.1 struggled significantly. Deepseek-R1 also had trouble, and failed to
return in a timely manner; either it was still thinking, entered an infinite loop, or something else
failed during the test.

Other failure modes include: calling tools too frequently, or not at all; pretending to call tools;
and hallucinating tool output. Models also may not trust tool output. For example, qwen3 did not
believe the date was 2026, as its training had completed in Dec 2023.

The system prompt can have a large effect on successful tool use. The models need to be told that
they have access to tools, guidance on how to use them, and instruction to trust tool output.
Details on each tool's definition are also important; more on that below.

There are a number of things that can affect tool usage:

- Model training, targeted fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.
- The model's ability to follow precise instructions, as function calls require absolute correctness.
- Judgment about which tool to call, and when to call it. Larger models typically excel here.
- Long context and multi-step reliability. Models that handle these better will excel. Lost
  context will affect results.
- Distilled models tend to fail on unfamiliar toolsets.
- Harness quality: clear tool descriptions, useful error messages, sensible defaults, and a quality
  agent loop all affect tool use success.

### Ollama Tool Definition Parsing

Another notable learning is that the Ollama Python library parses the Python function definition and
docstring to create a JSON tool definition that is passed to the model. Ollama requires that we use
[Google-style function docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods).
Ollama parses the following:

- **Name**: the function's name becomes the tool's name.
- **Type hints**: these become the parameter types, e.g. expression: str.
- **Docstring**: the summary becomes the tool's description, and each line under `Args:` becomes a
  parameter description. Anything under `Returns:` or `Raises:` is skipped.

This is done via the `convert_function_to_tool()` method in
[`ollama/_utils.py`](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/blob/b28b1e8a8cf5436d06805e5bb211904e9ff53ef9/ollama/_utils.py#L56).

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Chain-of-thought reasoning is a technique that models use to reason through complex queries and
produce more accurate results. Rather than generating an answer immediately, the model is trained to
think step-by-step, producing an internal monologue of "thoughts". This allows the model to reason
in smaller steps, which it can then compose into a final answer.

Chain-of-thought reasoning produces higher quality responses with fewer errors, though of course it
does require more time and higher token usage.

Google Researchers published the foundational paper
[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)
in January 2022, in which they demonstrated that large language models could perform multi-step math
and logic if the user provided a few step-by-step examples in the prompt.
Later, in [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)
(May 2022), Kojima et al. showed that simply adding the phrase _"Let's think step by step"_ in the
prompt could unlock similar reasoning capabilities.

For clarification, note that **chain-of-thought prompting** involves prompting the model to reason
in a step-by-step fashion. In contrast, a **reasoning model** is _trained_ to produce a thinking
trace. These models can support different levels of reasoning (eg: low, medium, high).

## Terminology

This work has exposed me to a number of new terms, which require clarification. For completeness,
I've also included some of the more basic terms (model, assistant). Definitions were shamelessly
copied from Claude:

**Model**\
The trained neural network: learned weights plus the architecture that uses them. It takes input
(text, images, tokens) and produces output, usually by predicting one token at a time. On its own
it has no memory between calls, no tools, and no goals. Examples: Llama 3, Claude Opus, GPT-5,
Qwen. Sometimes "model" means the weights file, such as a GGUF you run in Ollama. Sometimes it
means the hosted service behind an API.

**Assistant**\
Two related meanings:

1. **A role in a conversation.** In chat formats, `assistant` marks the model's turns, as opposed
   to `user`, `system` and `tool`.
2. **A product built for conversation.** A model tuned to follow instructions and chat helpfully,
   usually wrapped in an app. Examples: ChatGPT, the Claude app, Siri. An assistant mostly responds
   to you one turn at a time.

**Agent**\
A system in which a model acts in a **loop**. It decides what to do, calls tools, looks at the
results, and repeats until the goal is reached, with little human input between steps. The key
difference from an assistant is **autonomy over several steps**. An agent doesn't just answer. It
takes actions such as running code, browsing, or editing files. Examples: Claude Code, coding
agents, research agents. The line between "assistant" and "agent" is blurry, since many assistants
now use tools.

**Framework**\
A software library for **building** AI applications and agents. It supplies ready-made parts such as
prompt templates, tool definitions, memory, retrieval, multi-agent coordination, and adapters for
different model providers. Examples: LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, the Claude Agent SDK, the Vercel
AI SDK. You write code *with* a framework.

**Harness**\
The code **around** a model that turns it into a working agent or evaluation setup. It builds the
prompt, provides the tools, runs the loop, executes tool calls, feeds results back, enforces
permissions, and manages context. The term comes from "test harness." In evaluation, the harness
runs a model through benchmark tasks and scores it. In agents, it's the scaffolding that makes a
model act. For example, Claude Code is a harness around a Claude model. The same model can do much
better or worse depending on its harness.

**Runtime**\
The software that actually **executes** something. There are two common meanings:

1. **Inference runtime:** the engine that loads model weights and generates output on hardware.
   Examples: llama.cpp (which Ollama uses internally), vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, ONNX Runtime.
2. **Agent runtime:** the environment where an agent runs and keeps its state, such as a hosted
   service that runs agent loops, stores sessions, and provides sandboxes. Example: Anthropic's
   Managed Agents.

**How they fit together**\
Take Claude Code as an example:

* The **model** (Claude Opus) generates text and tool calls.
* It runs on Anthropic's **inference runtime** on their servers.
* Claude Code is the **harness**: it runs the loop, executes tools, and manages permissions and
  context.
* The result behaves as an **agent**, because it completes multi-step coding tasks on its own.
* It was built with, and is exposed as, the Claude Agent SDK, a **framework** you can use to build
  your own agents.
* Its conversation turns are labeled with the **assistant** role, and in casual use people call the
  whole thing a coding assistant.

A local setup might follow the same pattern: a Deepseek **model** served by Ollama's llama.cpp/GGLM
**runtime**, driven by a LangChain-based (**framework**) **harness**, which together make an
**agent**.
